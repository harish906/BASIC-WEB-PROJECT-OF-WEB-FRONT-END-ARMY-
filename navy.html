<h2>Navy records search can result in a wealth of information about the military veteran and family members.<br>
 Compiled service records include pay, promotions, dates of service, biographical information and medical information, and an overview of what the person experienced while serving in the U.S. military.<br>
Pension payment records also contain relevant information on those who served in the Navy from 1775 to 1916. <br>
These Navy records searches will tell you about marriages, births and deaths as well as often containing family letters, narratives of events that happened during service, and even pages from the family Bible. <br>
These historic documents are fascinating and useful for genealogists and family historians.</h2>
