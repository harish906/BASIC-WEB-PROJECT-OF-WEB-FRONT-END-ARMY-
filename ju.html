<h2><center>china attack on Nepal and Kathmandu:-</center></h2><br>
<italic>Kathmandu, Oct 21 – Despite Nepal’s ruling parties and the opposition Maoists saying they want to keep equidistance from their two neighbours, India and China<br>
The China scale has begun to grow heavier once again with several high-level official as well as personal visits to the communist republic.<br> 
While Nepal’s peace process remains in the doldrums with the former Maoist guerrillas refusing to disband their underground army, nearly a dozen ‘commanders’ of their People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and lawmakers are on a nine-day visit to China.<br>
These include two former deputy chiefs of the PLA, Barsha Man Pun Ananta and Janardan Sharma Prabhakar.<br>
Both are sitting Maoist MPs while Sharma is also the former Maoist peace and reconstruction minister.<br>
The Nagarik daily, which broke the news Thursday, said that though the Maoist party said the 11 were on a personal visit, they had met officials of the Communist Party of China as well as Chinese army officials in Beijing and Shanghai.<br>
 the special committee that was formed to facilitate the disbanding of the PLA.<br>
 With the two Maoist MPs on ‘vacation’, the special committee has not met even though time is running out for Nepal.<br>
The delay is worrying the UN that is involved in the peace process.<br>
After Nepal’s ruling parties and the Maoists signed a peace agreement in 2006 to end the decade-old communist insurgency<br>
 the UN was asked to help by monitoring the arms and combatants of the Nepal Army as well as the PLA.<br>
The UN Mission in Nepal (UNMIN), the UN agency mandated to monitor both the forces, is to exit Nepal after Jan 15, 2011, and a concerned UN has been repeatedly asking Nepal to speed up the discharge of the PLA.<br>
This month, the UN sent its Undersecretary General for Political Affairs, B. Lynn Pascoe, to Nepal to assess if there was any headway.<br>
While briefing the UN Security Council on his return from the visit<br> 
UNMIN chief Karin Landgren met Maoist chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal Prachanda Thursday to urge him to reach a quick consensus with the ruling parties and end the nearly four-month-long political deadlock.<br>
Nepal remains without a government since June when Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal was forced to resign due to Maoist pressure.<br>
Since then, the parties have been unable to elect a new premier despite 12 rounds of election.<br>
 Now the Maoists, the largest party in parliament, have threatened to prevent the caretaker government from tabling the new budget.<br>
The threat to plunge Nepal into a dire financial crisis is a pressure tactic to make the ruling parties support the Maoists form a new government under their leadership.<br>
 The Maoists have also threatened not to discharge the PLA till their demand is met.<br>
While the peace process languishes, Prachanda is heading towards China Friday for his fourth visit in two years.<br>
He was invited by the Chinese government to attend the Shanghai Expo 2010.<br>
Nepal’s Vice-President Parmananda Jha also leaves for the Shanghai Expo Thursday while President Ram Baran Yadav will go end of this month.</italic><br>
