<center><h2>INDIAN NAVY RULES:-</h2> <br>
 Indian Army Officers of the Rank of Brigadiers and above are required to take prior approval from competent authority of Indian Army, if they wish to join employment within two years of retirement. <br>
One particular Officer, who retired as Brigadier, joined employment the next day of his retirement. <br>
It is highly unlikely to get the above mentioned approval from the Army authorities within 24 hours of retirement. </h2><br>
