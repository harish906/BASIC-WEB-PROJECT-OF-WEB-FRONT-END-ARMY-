<h1>INDIAN AIR FORCE RULES:- <br>
 Indian Army Officers of the Rank of Brigadiers and above are required to take prior approval from competent authority of Indian Army, if they wish to join employment within two years of retirement. <br>
One particular Officer, who retired as Brigadier, joined employment the next day of his retirement. <br>
It is highly unlikely to get the above mentioned approval from the Army authorities within 24 hours of retirement. <br>
<br>
Air Force Records:-<br>
Air Force records for officers and enlisted personnel, separated after September 24, 1947, are held in the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, Missouri. <br>
Please note that many records were destroyed in a 1973 fire at the NPRC but employees will do their best to reconstruct information for records requests. <br>
Air Force records for personnel discharged or retired after September 30, 2004 have been digitized and are held by the Air Force.<br>
Searching Air Force records can be a confusing and involved process.<br>
 Save yourself time and frustration by contacting a private search company<br>.
 A records search company covers all relevant databases at once and delivers detailed reports to order.<br> 
Whether you are an Air Force veteran, a family member, a genealogist, or a student searching for historical information about Air Force personnel, contact a private records search company to make your records search much easier.<br>
